Every command typed into a terminal contains a wealth of information and insights. These commands are more than just inputs; they indicate problem-solving strategies, debugging techniques, and configurations required for software development and research. As computer scientists, our terminal interactions must be more than just executing code; they have a significant impact on our productivity.

I used to come across this particular scenario, which I am sure is relatable to everyone. Sometimes we are so focused on a complex coding session, juggling multiple projects, that we stumble upon a solution—a critical command that resolves a very important issue. But in the midst of tasks and deadlines, we frequently forget to document them. The following day, when we try to write the command again, we forget what it was and must start over.

This is where you need a command history manager.

## My Old Habits
In my coding endeavors, Linux has been my go-to platform, especially when working on my campus computer. The streamlined workflow and the flexibility it offers perfectly align with my needs. However, there are instances when I need to switch to Windows, typically while working on my personal computer. This switch is a necessity when processing data—whether it is using MATLAB or conducting pre-processing tasks using python.

On Linux, I've found great utility in the built-in bash history, a tool that allows me to recall and manage terminal commands seamlessly. The ability to install and use it directly from the terminal made it a convenient choice. However, my transition to Windows was met with a dilemma. I wasn't aware of a comparable tool and was hesitant to install applications without prior knowledge. And I always thought, I do not need terminal on windows that much.

This situation persisted until I encountered that scenario we all hate. The frustration of not having a command history manager was so obvious, forcing me to start over research. It was then that I realized just how important a command history manager is. It is so critical that we should not ignore it even if we think, "I code here just for a bit."

My frustation led me to discover a noteworthy solution for Windows—PowerShell's F7History feature. This feature simplifies the task of managing command history. The ability to install the module and seamlessly integrate it into my workflow proved to be a game-changer, significantly enhancing my productivity and efficiency.

# How to Install Powershell F7History

I will not discuss much here, since there are lots of articles and tutorials available everywhere. However, it is always good to summarize. Hence, I will do that for you so you can do it quickly.

### My Struggle with Installation
First, I found this summary regarding F7History [here](https://github.com/gui-cs/F7History/){:target="_blank"}, but it was not clear enough how to install the powershell. It says that we can do it by writing this command `Install-Module F7History`. But, it was not clear in which terminal we can do. I tried to find more resource, and I found this [site](https://powershellisfun.com/2023/07/26/powershell-out-consolegridview-and-f7history/), which gives more detail on powershell F7History. 

However, this also states about installing the module through terminal. I then tried both on command prompt. It could not work. And then, I tried on powershell terminal, this time, administrator right is required. So, this mean that we need to run the powershell as administrator. I also found [more information regarding powershell Install-Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/powershellget/install-module?view=powershellget-2.x){:target="_blank"}.

I will give you clear yet short summary here: 

## Installation Summary

### Installation from Powershell Terminal
1. Open Windows Powershell as administrator
2. Install the module: `Install-Module F7History`
3. Check wheter the F7History module has been installed: `Get-Module -ListAvailable`. You should find something like this if it has been installed.

### Manual Installation from Powershell Gallery
At first, I decided to install manually by downloading the package from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/F7History/1.3.0). You can also do the same, but this is not the most convenient way.

Well, then if you have downloaded the package, make sure that you copy them to the folder `F7History` to the directory:
- For the current user: `$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`
- For all users: `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`

You can skip this if you are able to install from terminal.

### Importing F7History Module to Powershell Profile Script
When you have installed the module (regardless of how you do it), now you can import it in your Powershell profile script. You can do it by:
1. Opening Windows Powershell (as administrator is still recommended).
2. Type the following command: `notepad $profile`
3. Add this inside the profile script: `Import-Module F7History`, then you can save and close the script.

For this stage, you might find some errors like you have no powershell profile script, then you can make sure of it by:
1. Run the following command in powershell terminal: `Test-Path $profile`. 
You will get `False`, if you have no profile, and you can proceed to create one.
2. You can create a new profile script by running: `New-Item -Path $profile -ItemType File -Force`
3. By then, your profile script has been created, so you can now open in your preffered text editor: `notepad $profile` to add the customization to the script.


## Installation Result

After successfully installing F7History for PowerShell, you may easily manage the history of your terminal commands. Simply hit `F7` or `Shift+F7` to access a user-friendly GUI displaying your command history. Please note that this GUI feature currently functions in the Windows Command Prompt (cmd) terminal, at least for me.
