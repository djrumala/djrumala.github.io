Greetings, I am <b>Dewinda</b>. Welcome on my homepage!

I am currently working remotely as an AI Research Engineer at a European-based startup. I hold a PhD from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Indonesia, where my research focused on the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, particularly in medical image analysis.

More recently, my work has expanded to include generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs).

Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
