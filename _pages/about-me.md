During my PhD, I have been focusing on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Biomedical Image analysis. My research under the supervision of Prof. I Ketut Eddy Purnama focuses on advancing these fields especially in the application of brain disease diagnosis. I am deeply engaged in exploring the theoretical foundations and technical aspects of AI research. Recently, I also explore Generative AI and LLM.

In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in nature 🌳🌴 Walking and biking could work for me 🚶‍♀️🚴‍♀️ 

When I still feel like 'I want to learn' during my free time, I love spending time learning new foreign languages📚🌍 Currently, I am more serious about learning Korean and Japanese. I want to learn European languages, but they are too hard for me at the moment🤯 

I also love experimenting with new fusion food recipes 👩‍🍳 that blend international flavors with the rich cultural tapestry of my Madurese heritage.

To unwind, I sometimes spend my time singing karaoke🎶 or watching Korean dramas 🎬 usually accompanied by ayam geprek noodle. 🍜 But I love psychological thriller K-dramas more than the romantic ones tho!
